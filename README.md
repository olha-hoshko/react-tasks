# react-tasks
Repo for react tasks.

## HW1
This project was created to practice working with API (namely JSONPlaceholder). It simply shows received data from each request. Also there is a theme change button.

## HW2
This project is some kind of a local messanger or a chat room. Here you can see users online and select them to send messages. To do so you need to start a server and open more than 1 tab with UI in browser. Here is no registration or authorization provided, so after refreshing a page you'll be a new user and a chat history will be cleared.
